## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithms that puts elements of a list into an order

### Bubble sort Algorithm
 * Bubble sort, is a simple algorithm. 
 * This algorithm will compare algorithms in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared 
 * and the element are swapped if they are not in order.
 * Due to the fact that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2)
 * @bubbleSort is used when we have a small input it is not suitable for large data

### Merge sort Algorithm
 merge sort algorithm runs slower with small input but it will be faster than Bubble sort when the input becomes larger

### Quick Sort Algorithm
 * This sorting algorithm is used for information searching and as Quicksort is the fastest algorithm so it is widely used as a better way of searching .
 * It is used where a stable sort is not needed
 * sorting n objects takes only n(log n) time
 * In the worst-case scenario, it takes quadratic (i.e, n2) time
 * Merge sort is more efficeint and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size and datasets
 * Quick sort is more efficient and works faster then merge sort in case of smaller array size and datasets
